#### Tutorial 2 - Use articfical neural network to label images (Rowan)

This tutorial is in `python`. The original is here: https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html, but we also provided the code here in this repository: [cifar10_tutorial.ipynb](cifar10_tutorial.ipynb).

Description:

- Use `pytorch` to train and test articfical neural network to label images.

Notes:

- Should run smoothly on your laptop. Maybe takes a minute or two.
