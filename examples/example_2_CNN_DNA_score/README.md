#### Example 2 - Simulate synthetic DNA data and train model to predict score using CNN (Marida)

This tutorial is in `python`. The original is here: https://github.com/erinhwilson/dna-pytorch-tutorial/blob/main/basic_DNA_tutorial.ipynb, but we also provided the code here in this repository: [basic_DNA_tutorial.ipynb](basic_DNA_tutorial.ipynb).

Description:

- Build a `Pytorch` model to predict a score from a DNA sequence.
- Simulate synthetic DNA data and train model to predict score.
- Visualize convolutional filters to gain better understanding of the model.

Notes:

- Should run smoothly on your Laptop.
