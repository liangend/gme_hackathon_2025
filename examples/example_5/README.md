#### Example 5 (Matthias)

This tutorial is in `R`. The original is here: https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorials/keras/classification, but we also provide a slightly modified version here in this repository: [image_classification.Rmd](image_classification.Rmd).

Description:

- Classify images of clothing items.
- Build, compile, train, test model
- Visualize predictions.

Notes:

- Should run smoothly on your Laptop if `tensorflow` and `keras` is installed properly.
- Did actually not run properly on Matthias' Macboook (M2).
